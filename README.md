# something-something-v2-baseline

**_Note_: An updated version of this repo is here: https://github.com/TwentyBN/smth-smth-v2-baseline-with-models
It contains pre-trained models (on smth-smth) to facilitate extracting features on your own datasets!**

Contains code to get you started with a baseline on version 2 of "something-something" dataset

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch: 0.4.0 (conda installation preferred - ref https://pytorch.org/)
- torchvision
- matplotlib
- skvideo (scikit-video)
- ffmpeg
- opencv-python
- sh
- PyAV (`conda install av -c conda-forge`)

## Setting up

#### Download the dataset
The dataset is provided in the form of videos in `webm` format using VP9 
encoding, occupying a total size of 19.4 GB. The videos are in landscape format
with height (the shorter side) of 240px at 12 frames/sec.

- Follow instructions on the data page
- Download the json files to fetch annotations of the data

#### Modify config file to include the above paths
In configuration file (located at `configs/config_model1.json`), modify the
- path to data: `data_folder`
- path to JSONs: `json_data_train`, `json_data_val`, `json_data_test`

#### How to train from scratch?
Run: `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python train.py -c configs/config_model1.json -g 0,1 --use_cuda`

where,
- `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`: environment variable to specify GPU ids to use. 
(_Note: uses all gpus if not specified_)

### Hyperparameters
Please refer to config file at: `configs/config_model1.json`
- `batch_size: 30` - change this to fill your GPU memory (_Note: should be a 
multiple of number of gpus used_)
- `num_workers: 5`: number of parallel processes to fetch and pre-process data
 (increase to max possible CPU cores you have to get better GPU utilisation)
- `lr: 0.008` - increase it if you happen to increase the batch size
- `clip_size: 72` - number of frames in a video sample as input to the model 
(which at default 12 fps covers 6 secs)
- `step_size_train: 1` - factor by which FPS is reduced 
 (so a step size of 2 would mean an fps of 6)
- `input_spatial_size: 84` - dimension of each frame in input is scaled
 and cropped to 84x84, but you can use the ubiquitous frame size of 224x224, 
 since the data is provided with height of 240px in landscape format
- `column_units: 512`: desired number of units in feature space for each sample

## How to use a pre-trained model?
- We provide a vanilla implementation of VGG-styled 3D-CNN with 11 layers of 
3D convolutions. Please refer here: 
[model3D_1.py](https://github.com/TwentyBN/smth-smth-baseline/blob/master/models/model3D_1.py)

- Use the [notebook](https://github.com/TwentyBN/smth-smth-baseline/blob/master/notebooks/get_prediction_from_pre_trained_model.ipynb)
 to get predictions from this model

## Test model and get submission file on test data
Modify path to model file in `checkpoint` variable of config file

`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python train.py -c configs/config_model1.json -g 0,1 -r -e --use_cuda`

The options used here are:
- `-r`: to resume an already trained model
- `-e`: to evaluate the model on test data

## Grad-CAM
Use the [notebook](https://github.com/TwentyBN/smth-smth-baseline/blob/master/notebooks/get_saliency_maps_CAM.ipynb)
 to visualize saliency maps of any example from validation set

## Commonsense score
Use the [notebook](https://github.com/TwentyBN/smth-smth-baseline/blob/master/notebooks/analyse_predictions-confusion_contrastive_groups.ipynb)
 to fetch commonsense score using contrastive groups list in directory `assets/`
